  <h3>
    Particle Connect Avalanche Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Boilerplate application for leveraging Particle Connect alongside Particle's AA SDK within Avalanche applications. This demo onboards a user either through social login with Particle Auth Core, or through (one of many) supported external wallets, then assigns a smart account and facilitates either a single or batched sample transaction (a burn of 0.0001 AVAX).

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **Particle Connect**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.

## üîå Particle Connect
Particle Connect is a collection of wallet adapters and components capable of facilitating connection with Particle Auth (Web2 logins), and various third-party wallet providers (Web3 logins), resulting in a dynamic RainbowKit-like connection cmechanism.
